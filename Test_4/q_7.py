# Write a program "list_anagrams.py" to find anagrams in a given list of words. 
# Two words are called anagrams if one word can be formed by rearranging letters of another. 
# For example 'eat', 'ate' and 'tea' are anagrams.
# Assume the list given is ['eat', 'ate', 'done', 'tea', 'soup', 'node'] 
# then it should return [['eat','ate','tea], ['done','node'], ['soup']]
